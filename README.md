# philanthrofood
+ The purpose of this project is to build an application that aims to reduce food insecurity by redistributing excess food. 
+ The application sets up a food menu online and customers can easily place the order as per their wish and can easily track the orders. 
+ The application also provides a feedback system in which the user can rate the food items. 
+ The payment can be made online or by cash-on-delivery. Separate accounts are maintained for each user by using the mobile number and a password. 
+ As the food here is excess,the available items in the menu are updated based on the time elapsed after being made. 
+ Items that still remain after a certain time period are discarded from the menu. 
+ Also the food items are provided at a rate lower than the market price
